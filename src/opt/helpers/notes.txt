March 28, 2016
* Add a new recommendation algorithm for drivers not on their tasks
  - This algorithm does not use Google Directions API but use straight line
    distance
* Add a new scoring algorithm for recommendations
  - The score is better if it is near the driver or near the route of the 
    task
  - The score is better if a station has a price lower than average
  - The score is better if a station is an Arco station
* Improve the gas station scrapping mechanism to include almost 8000 
  stations
  - If the price data for a station are blank, the average price is 
    used for scoring
* Remove all non-first-tier stations from recommendations

Some notes on implementation for Wotao

This routine collects gas station data from MapQuest. In sketch, it
grabs gas station data with price from the old API, and then it grabs
those with no price information from the new API, and tries to merge
them. (See our discussion history) To merge, it traverses the new
data list and sees if the old data list has had an entry for each
station. If true, it leaves the old list unchanged; otherwise, it
formats the station in the new data list and inserts it to the old
list. Finally, it writes the augmented old list to the file system.

---
This routine reads the local stations data. After finishing reading,
it removes all non-top-tier stations and blacklisted stations.

This routine first calls our old routine for distance calculation,
then thread the result with a series of computations. By these computations,
the routine knows (1) how low is the price of a station compared to the
average; (2) if a station is an Arco station. Finally, the routine
gives a final score to each station using the following formula:
%% score = (price / avg_price) * (arco ? 0.8 : 1.0) * driving_time %%
---
* suggest-gas-stations-near-with-score at gas_station_recommendation_helpers.clj:330 *
---
Similar to the previous one, but this routine computes the point to point
distance instead of the driving time from the driver to each station.
Therefore, the formula is slightly changed to:
%% score = (price / avg_price) * (arco ? 0.8 : 1.0) * distance * 1000 %%
Note that the distance is approximated by viewing latitudes and longitudes
as Cartesian coordiates.
